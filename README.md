# RPredicting-Liver-Cirrhosis-using-Advanced-Machine-Learning-Techniques
🔍 Aim
To develop a machine learning web application that predicts whether a person is likely to have liver cirrhosis based on their medical data. This tool aims to support early detection and assist healthcare professionals in decision-making.

📁 Dataset
The dataset contains clinical data of 1000 patients including features like Total Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin, Alkaline Phosphatase, Aminotransferases (SGPT/SGOT), Protein levels, Albumin, A/G Ratio, Age, and Gender.

🧠 Algorithm Used
The model is built using the Random Forest Classifier from scikit-learn, along with StandardScaler for feature normalization. The model was trained to classify whether the patient has liver cirrhosis or not.

🛠 Technologies

Python
Flask (Web Framework)
Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
HTML + CSS (for frontend)
🌐 Output
A user-friendly web application where users can input medical values and get a result such as "Cirrhosis Detected ✅" or "No Cirrhosis ❎".

🎯 Impact
This system can help identify potential liver cirrhosis cases earlier, enabling timely medical intervention. It demonstrates how machine learning can contribute to preventive healthcare.
